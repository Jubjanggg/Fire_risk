"* Spreadsheet version of April 27 2011 was used, except for the temperate forest biome where new published measurements were incorporated (updated version of May 2014)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
* For certain species & biomes the EF comilation of Andreae and Merlet (2001) including updates till 2013 was used to fill some EF data gaps (gray cells).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"* Biome-specific Carbon Content (CC) was estimated from CO2, CO, and CH4 EFs, assuming that these species represent the main bulk of C emissions during a fire",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"* 'Agricultural Waste' corresponds to the 'Crop Residue' biome used by Akagi et al., 2011",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"* The 'Peat' biome is the average of lab measurements conducted in boreal peat (Yokelson et al., 1997) and tropical peat (Christian et al., 2003). For comparison, other 'Peat' estimates are given as well, all based on different assumptions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"* The 'Toluene_lump' category is derived from summed emission factors of benzene, toluene, xylene",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"* The 'Higher_Alkenes' category is derived from summed emission factors of all alkenes (C>=4) specified in Andreae and Merlet (2001) which are not contained in the Toluene_lump group. These are: Butenes (1-butene + i-butene + tr-2-butene + cis-2-butene) (C4H8), Pentenes  (1-pentene + 2-pentene) (C5H10), Hexene  (C6H12), Octene  (C8H16)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"* The 'Higher_Alkanes' category is derived from summed tropical forest emission factors of all alkanes (C>=4) specified in A&M09. These are: Butanes (n-butane + i-butane) (C4H10), Pentanes (n-pentane+ i-pentane (me-butane)) (C5H12), Hexane (n-hexane + i-hexane) (C6H14), Heptane (C7H16)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
